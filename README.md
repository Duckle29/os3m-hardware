Welcome to the mechanical repository of the OS3M mouse! Here you'll find all the pieces you need to make your own OS3M mouse, with the exception of 9 * M3x10 fasteners, the PCB and 3 dimes (USA 10 cent coin). I try to only commit and push when I have a fully compatible set of parts, so at any given time you should be able to clone this repo and build your own using its contents.

One of the beautiful things about this mouse is that if you don't like some aspect of it, you can just change it! Particularly when it comes to the flexure inside the mouse, if you want more or less stiffness, fork and edit away! Feel free to leave any issues in the issues tab as you find them.
