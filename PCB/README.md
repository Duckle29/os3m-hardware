# OS3M Mouse PCB
![](PCB/pcb_overview.PNG?raw=true)
Here are all the files pertaining to the OS3M mouse's PCB. I only commit and push here when I have a full revision update to the PCB. So far there are only 2 revisions, 0 and 1, and you should only make the current one (1). Gerbers can be found in the os3m-gerbers folder, and can be sent to JLC for easy fab. I also plan on selling these on tindie at some point.
