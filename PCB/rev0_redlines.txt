- accidentally ordered an 0402 resistor for R1 when footprint was 0603
- LED is too damn bright
- didn't put fucking SDA and SCL test points
- C11 - C15 in a line like they are was painful to get in place
- 0402s are generally a pain. 0603 possible?
- 2n caps should be 1n for good parallel impedance
- INTB should be connected on both LDCs for interrupt driven comms
- use the STM32 with the larger flash, worth the extra 10c or whatever
- add 40MHz external oscillator for increased accuracy
